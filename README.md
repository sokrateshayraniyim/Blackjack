# Blackjack Game using C# Console

In this project, a Blackjack game has been developed using the C# programming language and console applications. The aim of the game is for the total of the sum of the open cards of the dealer and the player to be closest to 21. The game starts with the player being given two cards and the dealer being given one card face up and one card face down. The player then has the option to hit and receive additional cards or stand with their current total. The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher, and then must stand. The player wins if their total is higher than the dealer's total, or if the dealer busts (goes over 21). Aces are worth either 1 or 11, face cards are worth 10, and all other cards are worth their face value.

The game continues until either the player or dealer wins, or until both have reached a tie. At the end of each game, the player has the option to restart the game or quit. 

This project serves as a basic implementation of the Blackjack game, and can be further expanded and modified to add additional features and gameplay elements.
